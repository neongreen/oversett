## What is happening here?

We are auto-translating web development docs into Russian, and later maybe other languages.

Right now this is used to teach web development to people who aren't fluent at English. See <https://webdev.artyom.me>.

## What docs are available?

- [MUI (Material UI, a React UI library)](https://mui.com)
  - [Russian translation](https://ru.mui.oversett.xyz)
