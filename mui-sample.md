# Card

<p class="description">Cards contain content and actions about a single subject.</p>

Cards are surfaces that display content and actions on a single topic.

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader.js"}}

## Basic card

Although cards can support multiple actions, UI controls, and an overflow menu, use restraint.

{{"demo": "BasicCard.js", "bg": true}}

### Outlined Card

Set `variant="outlined"` to render an outlined card.

{{"demo": "OutlinedCard.js", "bg": true}}

## Media

Example of a card using an image to reinforce the content.

:::warning
‚ö†Ô∏è When `component="img"`, CardMedia relies on `object-fit` for centering the image.

## UI Controls
